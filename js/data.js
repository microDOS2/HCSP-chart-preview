    intro: "Today's HCSP produces three things: clean water, energy, and a small amount of inert solid. Future versions would add separation steps — distillation, crystallization, and selective precipitation — that pull valuable substances out of the waste before or after the rest is destroyed, and sell them. That turns a disposal cost into a product: a second revenue stream on top of the destruction fees. Treat this as the manufacturer's roadmap and research direction, not a shipping feature — every stream below first has to pass a purity test and a market test.",
